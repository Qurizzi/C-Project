This program is designed to assist users such as managers, bookkeepers, or supervisors in managing basic employee data and performing routine calculations.

Currently, the application allows:

    - Viewing employee information (name, ID, age)

    - Running a basic calculator

    - Calculating salaries (hourly wage Ã— hours worked)

ðŸ”§ Note: The system is still under development. Many features are planned and will be added over time, including:

    - Adding and removing employees directly within the program

    - Counting the total number of employees in the database

    - Improved input handling and interface updates

 Two example users are currently hardcoded for demonstration purposes. You can change their data manually in the code for now â€” dynamic data editing will be implemented in future versions.
